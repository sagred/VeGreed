## About the product 🚀:

### Problem ⚠️:
The rise of social media, especially platforms like Instagram, has led to a trend where users buy physical products, showcase them online for clout and aesthetics, and then return the items. This behavior leads to logistical and financial challenges for businesses and undermines genuine product endorsements.

### Vision 🌟:
Ever noticed how people buy flashy items, flaunt them on Instagram, and then just return them? Our dApp aims to change that! By providing a transparent way for users to prove ownership and genuine use of products, we're here to make product endorsements meaningful again in the social media age.

## Unique Selling Points ✨:
- **Genuine Endorsements:** Verify real product ownership for social media posts.
- **Decentralized Trust:** Transparent, immutable proof using blockchain.
- **Ownership Rewards:** Incentives for long-term possession and use.
- **Easy Social Sharing:** Direct link between verification and platforms like Instagram.
- **Simple Interface:** User-friendly, whether you're tech-savvy or not.
- **Protect Business Revenue:** Reduce product returns and their financial impact.
- **Boost Brand Credibility:** Genuine endorsements only!
- **Versatile Use Cases:** It's not just for influencers. We cater to a wide audience.
- **Eco-Friendly:** Let's reduce the wasteful buy-showcase-return cycle.
- **Foster Authentic Community:** Building trust is at our core.

## Numbers back us 📈:
- **10 M** - Influencers on Instagram*
- **840 Billion** - Revenue losses in FY 20 due to returns**
